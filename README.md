# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-with-Python---practical-tasks
My version of answers to practical tasks from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. 

Here I will store examples of answers to practical tasks in mentioned online&book tutorial 
(https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/). Please be aware 
that these answers are up-to-date with the skill required at certain point of tutorial, so, of course, it 
might be a lot better way to solve it and the code itself sometimes is against Python style guide. 
I hope you will find it handy, as much as I hope you will try to solve the task before skipping in here! Have fun.

Important! Scripts are few months old (from the time when I was doing this tutorial) and 
must be redone before we could call it a 'bearable code' ;)

As I have started to learn Java, so I rewrote some of this practical tasks in this language.
